First things first, this application desperately needs refactoring.  It is far from DRY and has no tests.  But for recently learning MongoDB and Angular, this was a decent first go!



To run locally:
	- each in a new terminal tab, cd to project directory then:
	   - sudo mongod
     - mongo
     - nodemon
	- in browser, navigate to localhost:4200/index.html to access (port is defined in server/app.js)
